# Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Environment Setup

## Prerequisites:
1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB Community Edition. Follow instructions from the [official MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).
3. **Text Editor/IDE**: Choose a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) for coding. Examples include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

## Steps to Setup:
1. **Create a New Directory**: Start by creating a new directory for your project.

2. **Initialize Node.js Project**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

### npinit -y


3. **Install Dependencies**:
- Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
  ```
  npm install express
  ```
- MongoDB Native Driver or Mongoose (optional): To interact with MongoDB, you can either use the MongoDB Native Driver or Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
  ```
  npm install mongodb
  ```
  or
  ```
  npm install mongoose
  ```

4. **Setup Express Server**: Create a new file, e.g., `app.js`, and set up an Express server. Example:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});

## Connect to MongoDB:
If you're using MongoDB, establish a connection to your MongoDB database. Example using MongoDB Native Driver:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

client.connect(err => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB successfully');
    // Further database operations can be performed here
});

```
### Start the server:

Run the following command to start your Node.js server:

```bash
node app.js
```
